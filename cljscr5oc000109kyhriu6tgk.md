The first and most challenging step in entering the tech industry is selecting a technical field.

I was once stuck and asked myself the same question as many other people thriving in the tech industry today.

> This article is for anyone who wants to enter the tech industry but is unsure of which area best suits them.

We will respond to the earlier question shortly.

But first, here are a few reasons why you should secure a position in the tech sector:

* **Tech is the future;** it is the industry with the fastest rate of expansion. There is constant innovation, and it is nearly impossible to identify an industry that does not utilize IT.
    
* **There are many career options in the tech industry:** The inclusion of digital operations in businesses and organizations has increased the demand for IT professionals with the skills to support those operations.  
    The demand for IT workers will increase in the upcoming years at an unprecedented rate, according to many experts.
    
* **Ability to work remotely:** Working from home (remotely) is becoming more common in tech jobs thanks to technological advancements such as cloud storage, video conferencing, quick access to high-speed internet, and many other things.
    
* **You don't need a degree in Information Technology (IT) to get a job:** All you need to land a job in the tech industry is your IT skill(s), not a degree in computer science.  
    More and more employers are hiring people with the required skill set needed for the available position.

### **My answer to the question, "Is tech really for me?"**

Simply put, ***Tech is for everyone***. Everyone who is open to continuous learning.

You must be prepared to continuously learn new things and improve your skills because the tech world is evolving and changing all the time.

### **Things to consider when selecting a tech career**

* **Discover your interests**  
    Which area of technology makes you want to learn more and investigate it when you hear or talk about it? This is a crucial step because you'll be spending the majority of your time working in your chosen field. It must therefore be something you find appealing.
    
* **Identify your skills**  
    In this context, "skills" can refer to a wide range of things, including communication, writing, management, problem-solving, designing, and much more. List them all out and look for potential fields where you could use them as a benefit. As you learn, you will acquire the skills necessary for a particular field, so this step is optional.
    
* **Know your strengths and weaknesses**  
    It's important to figure out what you excel at and where you fall short. It stops people from choosing a field and abandoning it later after making vain attempts to learn it.
    
* **Carry out a thorough research**  
    Before choosing one, do extensive research on a variety of potential tech fields. Understanding a tech field's requirements, benefits, and employment opportunities is crucial. Before setting out on your journey, you must be aware of what you are getting into.
    
* **Ask questions**  
    Ask questions from professionals in the field or those who are already active in the tech sector.
    

In conclusion, it is not necessary to be a "Techie" to work in the tech industry. There are also many non-technical (no code) career paths in the tech industry.

Thank you for reading! I hope you found this article insightful.

*Happy learning!!!*
